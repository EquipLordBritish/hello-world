What happens if I...

This is a test repository to learn the online interface for github.  This is just a test.  If you respond to this test, you have failed in your duty.  You should report to your local psychological analysis and conditioning center and tell them what you did.

Just gonna add a line here and see what happens.  Also changed the 'only' to a 'just' in the second sentence.
